                        <hr>

                        <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
                            thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>

                        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                            Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All
                            of this left scars on me."
                        </li>

                            cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who
                            teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                        <hr>

                            is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control

                            years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
                            different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                        <hr>
                        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat

                            American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide

                            population </li>
                        <hr>

                            Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run
                            out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
                            genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                            people were selecting the best breeds." </li>
